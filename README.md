# MLT_CIA
CIA assignment for MLT - Akshat K

Python program comparing the best fit line plot using simple linear regression, gradient descent using least squares, and the sklearn library.

1000 points were plotted and each method has been commented using multi-line comments to uncomment for usage.

Thank you.
